# AgentRulesHub Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

The AgentRulesHub is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool designed to manage and provide contextual rules for AI agents. It allows agents to dynamically retrieve rules based on various criteria such as programming language or specific rule identifiers.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Rule Retrieval**: Access rules based on language, ID, or other metadata
- **YAML-based Rule Storage**: Rules are defined in YAML files
- **Configurable Rule Sources**: Specify locations for rule files via environment variables
- **MCP Integration**: Exposes functionality as tools consumable by MCP clients

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

1. **Core Implementation**:
   - `internal/tools/ruleshub/types.go`: Data models for rules and rule sources
   - `internal/tools/ruleshub/parser.go`: Parser for rule content
   - `internal/tools/ruleshub/loader.go`: Loader for rules from different sources
   - `internal/tools/ruleshub/repository.go`: In-memory repository for rule metadata
   - `internal/tools/ruleshub/orchestrator.go`: Orchestrator for coordinating rule loading
   - `internal/tools/ruleshub/ruleshub.go`: MCP tool implementation

2. **Tests**:
   - `internal/tools/ruleshub/ruleshub_test.go`: Unit tests for the ruleshub tool

3. **Documentation**:
   - `docs/tools/ruleshub.md`: Detailed documentation for the ruleshub tool
   - Updated `README.md` to include the new tool

4. **Sample Rules**:
   - `contextual-rules/implementation-plan/sample-rules/go-formatting.yaml`: Go formatting and style guidelines
   - `contextual-rules/implementation-plan/sample-rules/js-best-practices.yaml`: JavaScript best practices and coding standards

5. **Implementation Plan**:
   - `contextual-rules/implementation-plan/README.md`: Implementation plan and status

### Architecture

The AgentRulesHub follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Rule Loaders**: Responsible for loading rules from different sources (e.g., YAML files)
2. **Rule Parsers**: Parse rule content from specific formats (e.g., YAML)
3. **Rule Storage**: In-memory repository for storing and retrieving rule metadata
4. **Rule Loader Orchestrator**: Coordinates loading rules from multiple sources
5. **MCP Tools/API Layer**: Exposes functionality to MCP clients

### MCP Tools

The system exposes the following MCP tools:

1. **GetRuleContentById**: Retrieves the content of a specific rule by its ID
2. **GetAllRulesMetadata**: Retrieves metadata for all available rules

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how an AI agent might use the AgentRulesHub tool:

1. **Retrieve Rule Index**:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "ruleshub",
     "arguments": {
       "action": "GetAllRulesMetadata"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Analyze Task & Identify Relevant Rules**:
   The agent analyzes the task (e.g., "Format this Go code") and identifies relevant rules based on the metadata (e.g., rules with language="go" and tags=["formatting"]).

3. **Retrieve Rule Content**:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "ruleshub",
     "arguments": {
       "action": "GetRuleContentById",
       "ruleId": "go-formatting"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Apply Rules to Task**:
   The agent uses the retrieved rule content to guide its actions (e.g., formatting Go code according to the guidelines).

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Rule Sources**: Support for database and API-based rule sources
2. **Rule Filtering**: Enhanced filtering by language, tags, and other metadata
3. **Rule Versioning**: Support for versioned rules
4. **Rule Dependencies**: Support for rules that depend on other rules
5. **Rule Validation**: Validation of rule content and metadata
6. **Rule Caching**: Caching of rule content for improved performance
7. **Rule Hot Reloading**: Dynamic reloading of rules without server restart

## Conclusion

The AgentRulesHub tool provides a powerful way for AI agents to access contextual rules, improving their ability to adhere to specific guidelines and best practices. The modular architecture allows for easy extension and customization, while the MCP integration enables seamless interaction with AI agents.
