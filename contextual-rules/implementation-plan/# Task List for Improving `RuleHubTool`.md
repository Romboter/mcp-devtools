# Task List for Improving `RuleHubTool`

## Documentation
- [ ] Add comments for all exported methods:
  - [ ] `Definition`
  - [ ] `Execute`
  - [ ] `ensureInitialized`
  - [ ] `getRuleContentById`
  - [ ] `getAllRulesMetadata`
- [ ] Add comments for the `RuleHubTool` struct explaining its purpose and fields.

## Validation
- [ ] Create a helper function to validate and extract parameters from the `args` map in the `Execute` method.
- [ ] Ensure all required parameters are validated with clear error messages.

## Error Messages
- [ ] Improve error messages for better user understanding:
  - [ ] Rephrase "ruleId parameter is required for GetRuleContentById" to "The 'ruleId' parameter is missing or invalid for the 'GetRuleContentById' action."
  - [ ] Review and refine other error messages for clarity.

## Performance
- [ ] Optimize the `getAllRulesMetadata` method to handle large datasets efficiently:
  - [ ] Consider streaming or batching results if the number of rules is very large.

## Initialization
- [ ] Make the repository and orchestrator configurable during initialization:
  - [ ] Add options to pass custom implementations of `RuleRepository` and `RuleLoaderOrchestrator`.

## JSON Marshalling
- [ ] Add tests to cover edge cases for JSON marshalling:
  - [ ] Test scenarios where the data structure changes or contains unexpected values.

## Testing
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases:
  - [ ] Missing or invalid parameters in the `Execute` method.
  - [ ] Errors during rule loading or repository initialization.
  - [ ] Large datasets in `getAllRulesMetadata`.
  - [ ] JSON marshalling failures.

## Logging
- [ ] Review logging statements to ensure they provide sufficient context for debugging.
- [ ] Ensure sensitive information is not logged.

## Code Cleanup
- [ ] Review and remove any unused imports or variables.
- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting and adherence to Go naming conventions.

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Consider adding support for additional actions in the `Execute` method.
- [ ] Explore caching mechanisms for frequently accessed rules to improve performance.
